# Vehicle-Detection-and-Speed-Estimation
This project leverages AI and Data Science techniques to detect vehicles in video footage and accurately estimate their speed in real-time. Using a combination of computer vision, deep learning, and object tracking algorithms, the system processes video input from traffic surveillance or dashcams to monitor and analyze vehicular movement.
