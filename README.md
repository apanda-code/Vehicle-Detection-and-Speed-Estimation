# Vehicle-Detection-and-Speed-Estimation
This project leverages AI and Data Science techniques to detect vehicles in video footage and accurately estimate their speed in real-time. Using a combination of computer vision, deep learning, and object tracking algorithms, the system processes video input from traffic surveillance or dashcams to monitor and analyze vehicular movement.
🔍 Features
Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv5 (or other object detection models)

Vehicle tracking using DeepSORT or centroid tracking algorithms

Speed estimation based on pixel displacement and camera calibration

Visualization of bounding boxes, object IDs, and speed on live video

Support for multiple vehicle types (cars, trucks, bikes, etc.)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

YOLOv5 / YOLOv8

DeepSORT

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for analysis and visualization)

📁 Project Structure
